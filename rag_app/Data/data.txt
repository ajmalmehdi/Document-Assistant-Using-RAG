Program: "Engineering of Ubiquitous and Distributed Systems – Cloud and IoT"
The "Engineering of Ubiquitous and Distributed Systems – Cloud and IoT" program aims to train engineers capable of driving the proactive digitalization policy of administration and businesses in Morocco. Without engineers possessing the necessary skills in the job market, the success of this digital transition would be compromised.

Digitalization, which is inevitable in this context, cannot ignore the rapid rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has taken hold not only in the business world but also among citizens. The emergence of billions of connected objects generates significant amounts of data, requiring adequate processing, storage, and analysis.

To meet these needs, the computing power of machines continues to increase through the virtualization of services and the adoption of cloud computing techniques. Cloud computing, which involves networking distributed machines, allows for addressing the growing demand for processing power.

Finally, data storage is often outsourced to specialized centers such as data centers. Thus, the company of the future will adopt a model centered on its core business, outsourcing the processing and storage of its data, whether internally or externally.

In this context, the "Engineering of Ubiquitous and Distributed Systems – Cloud and IoT" program trains engineers who will play an essential role as project managers, integrating IoT skills and cloud infrastructure development to meet future challenges.

The skills to be developed for engineers have been carefully designed to promote their full integration into society by addressing challenges and meeting needs in interactivity, know-how, and soft skills. This shift in the definition of the engineer's role pushes us to adopt a new pedagogical approach, allowing engineering students to acquire both major and minor skills that encompass the whole personality of the engineer.
